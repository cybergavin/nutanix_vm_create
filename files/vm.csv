# This is a sample data file that is to be used along with the cybergavin.nutanix_vm_create
# ansible role for provisioning VMs on a Nutanix cluster. Such a file should be created
# with the proper values and called by your main playbook.
# This is a comma-separated-values file containing the list of VMs to be created.
# In the example below:
#  vm_name       => VM's Name
#  ip            => VM's IP address
#  subnet_name   => VM's subnet
#  image_name    => Name of the disk image used to create the VM
#  num_vcpu      => Number of vCPU sockets for the VM
#  memory_mib    => VM's memory size in MiB
#  disk_list_mib => Additional VM disk sizes in MiB (hyphen-separated)
#
#  NOTE: All attributes are mandatory, except disk_list_mib. If you do not wish
#  to add disks to the VM, keep the placeholder empty (,,)

# Example 1: A VM with 2 vCPUs/4 GB RAM and 2 added disks
